On September 20, 2023, I gave a talk at Auburn's Department of Mathematics & Statistics' Graduate Student Seminar for first-year students titled "Understanding math through code: an algebra project." I presented on the importance of computer programming in mathematics graduate school and a computational algebra project from my Algebra independent study with Hal Schenck in Spring 2023. The slides can be found [here](./GSS_9_20_2023___Riemann_Surfaces.pdf).
