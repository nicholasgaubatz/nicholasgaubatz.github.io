On September 20, 2023, I am planning to give a talk at Auburn's Department of Mathematics & Statistics' Graduate Student Seminar for first-year students titled "Programming in grad school: an overview and an algebra project." I'll be presenting about the importance of computer programming in mathematics graduate school and a computational algebra project from my algebra independent study in Spring 2023.

Writing in progress.
