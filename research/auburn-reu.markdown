title: A day in the life of a mathematics REU participant
permalink: /research/auburn-reu

My REU at Auburn University in 2021 was the most formative experience in my mathematics education.

My goal is to outline my experience in this program. I remember applying to REUs throughout my undergraduate career, and I would have really benefitted from a rundown on what to expect. Of course, every REU is unique, but this was my experience.

My program lasted 8 weeks, from June 6 to July 31. I plan on discussing the main parts as follows:
1. Living in a residence hall with other REU participants.
2. Attending lectures and talks from graduate students and professors.
3. Presenting my own "icebreaker talk".
4. Conducting my own research and writing my own mathematics paper.
