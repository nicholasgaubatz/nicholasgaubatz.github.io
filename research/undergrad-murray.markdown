As a Presidential Fellow at Murray State, I conducted ~5 hours a week of research starting the spring semester of my freshman year. During 2019, I learned about wavelets from Dr. David Roach. I read about parametrizations of wavelets of varous lengths, and I even independently rediscovered conditions and solutions for lengths four and six. Dr. Roach was a great mentor, and I am very grateful that he mentored me as a freshman who had barely scratched the surface of mathematics.

I think that one of the main goals of undergraduate education in mathematics should be to get a broad exposure to as many different areas as possible. Becuase of this viewpoint, starting the spring semester of 2020 I switched fields to algebraic combinatorics, researching under Dr. Rob Donnelly.
