This crab rangoon was very sweet, probably the second sweetest one we've encountered (behind August Moon). They were slightly stale and tough to break apart and not very crunchy. The sweet and sour sauce that came with them was very tasty. They didn't come with much filling, which is the best part.

The price was $4.50 for 6, which is a fantastic deal.

Will order again when we go here, but we wouldn't seek them out on their own.
