These had LOTS of filling, which was fantastic! Although the filling wasn't very sweet, it still had a crab taste. It also tasted like onions, which was interesting. It's a unique shape for crab rangoon, very bunched up and not very crisp due to all of the filling and material of the wonton.

The price was $5.62 for 8 for carry out, or the price of the buffet.

The next time we go, we will definitely be getting more!
