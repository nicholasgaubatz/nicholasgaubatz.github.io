This is the gold standard for crab rangoon. The rangoons that any crab would want to be part of (even though it doesn't have any crab).

We've gone here so many times, and every time we've come away satisfied. They're delightfully sweet, decadently crispy, with the perfect amount of filling. They have almost a flaky wanton that provides a satisfying crunch. It's literally just cream cheese, but we don't care. This is what we compare every place to.

The price was either $5.29 for 6 for carry out, or included in the price of the buffet.
