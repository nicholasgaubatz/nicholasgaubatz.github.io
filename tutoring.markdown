I will soon be accepting students for private tutoring for Fall 2024 mathematics and statistics classes. Please feel free to contact me at my email below to see my rates or schedule a time.

I have two years of experience as a tutor in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics at Murray State, and I have privately tutored 6 students at Auburn in the following classes as of Summer 2023:
  - MATH 1000: College Algebra
  - MATH 1610: Calculus I
  - MATH 1690: Calculus with Business Applications II
  - MATH 2650: Linear Differential Equations
  - STAT 3600: Probability and Statistics I

Additionally, in Fall 2023 I taught MATH 1690: Calculus with Business Applications II as instructor of record.
