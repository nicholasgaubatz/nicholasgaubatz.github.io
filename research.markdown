I have conducted research in various areas of mathematics, data science, and computer science. My advisors are Mark Carpenter (Statistics) and Hal Schenck (Algebraic Geometry), and I am currently working on projects in both fields. 

Major graduate school experiences so far:
  - [Upcoming] [Multigraded and differential graded methods in commutative algebra](https://www.slmath.org/summer-schools/1115): Summer Graduate School at St. Mary's College.
  - [Macaulay2, Computational Algebraic Geometry and String Theory](https://sites.google.com/view/utahm2stringtheory/home): workshop and conference at the University of Utah, May 28 through June 5.
  - [A talk at my department's Fall 2023 Graduate Student Seminar](/research/gss-talk-f23) about an independent project conducted during my Spring 2023 Algebra independent study with my advisor Hal Schenck.

History of undergraduate research activities:
  - [Presidential Fellowship research](/research/undergrad-murray) at Murray State University (my undergrad institution),
  - an [REU](/research/auburn-reu) in Algebra & Discrete Mathematics at Auburn University, and
  - an [REU](/research/lsu-reu) in Computational Science at Louisiana State University.

Original publications/writings:
  - ["Friends in Z_n"](http://ijmcs.future-in-tech.net/17.2/R-Gaubatz-Johnson.pdf), a paper coauthored with Dr. Peter Johnson at my Auburn REU, and
  - [Quantum Dimension Polynomials: A Networked-Numbers Game Approach](https://digitalcommons.murraystate.edu/honorstheses/127/), my Honors Thesis at Murray State.
