I have conducted research in various areas of mathematics and computer science. My history of research activities includes
  - [Presidential Fellowship research](/research/undergrad-murray) at Murray State University (my undergrad institution),
  - an [REU](/research/auburn-reu) in Algebra & Discrete Mathematics at Auburn University, and
  - an [REU](/research/lsu-reu) in Computational Science at Louisiana State University.

My original publications/writings include
  - ["Friends in Z_n"](http://ijmcs.future-in-tech.net/17.2/R-Gaubatz-Johnson.pdf), a paper coauthored with Dr. Peter Johnson at my Auburn REU, and
  - [Quantum Dimension Polynomials: A Networked-Numbers Game Approach](https://digitalcommons.murraystate.edu/honorstheses/127/), my Honors Thesis at Murray State.

Information about my upcoming Fall 2023 talk at the department's Graduate Student Seminar can be found [here](/research/gss-talk-f23).
