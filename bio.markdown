My name is Nicholas Gaubatz. I am a Mathematics PhD student at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama.

I grew up in Illinois, and I have always been interested in math, video games, and music. I have seriously played the piano since age 7 and the organ since age 13, and I dabble in the guitar and violin. I used to professionally play the piano and organ at various Catholic churches in my home area until the pandemic hit. My absolute favorite composer is Chopin. In high school, my favorite organizations were the math team, scholar bowl, band/choir, and the golf team. Additionally, my favorite video games are Minecraft, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and God of War.

I attended undergrad at Murray State University in Murray, KY, where I majored in mathematics and minored in computer science. I participated heavily in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics and various student organizations over my four years, and I also served as an RA my senior year. I held one of Murray State's Presidential Fellowships, a full-ride scholarship. My undergraduate career culminated in my award of Outstanding Senior Man, and I was able to give a valediction at the May 2022 Commencement ceremony. My speech can be found [here](https://youtu.be/M40MNKYKpEc?t=2769).

I am currently in my first year in my PhD program at Auburn University, where I have been named a Presidential Graduate Research Fellow. I am in the process of satisfying my preliminary sequence and exam requirements, and while I am still mostly undecided about what field of mathematics I want to go into, I have been leaning toward something algebra-related since I started grad school. My goal is to become a university professor, where I can research my interests, teach valuable mathematics, and serve in a campus community. Please feel free to browse some of my research writings and experiences.
