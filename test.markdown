Welcome to an interactive version of the grid out-neighborhood problem! Here, you can test different configurations of the set $$S$$ to see how $$N_{+}(S)$$ changes. 

The grid square with the red box represents the origin $$(0,0)$$, which is a type-1 vertex (out-neighbors are left and right, and in-neighbors are up and down). To add/remove a grid square to/from $$S$$, simply left-click. The set $$S$$ is represented by blue squares, while $$N_{+}(S)$$ is represented by greeen squares.
